- Results considering different weeks with the same and higher PV penetrations demonstrate an average error of less than 2 Volts; showing that, in the absence of LV electrical models, the methodology could be used by distribution companies for different applications

- However, the main challenge for distribution companies is that accurate voltage calculations require power ï¬‚ow analyses that need detailed electrical models which, in the context of LV networks, are not readily available in most parts of the world. The associated data (e.g., topology, connectivity, phase grouping, impedances, etc.) is often erroneous or incomplete [5], [6] which makes the production of electrical models a very time-consuming and costly task
